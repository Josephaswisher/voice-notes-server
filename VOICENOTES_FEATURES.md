# 🎯 VoiceNotes-Style Features Added

**Inspired by VoiceNotes.com - AI-powered voice note processing**

---

## ✨ New AI Features

### 1. **Auto-Summarization**
Every voice note gets an AI-generated summary:
- 2-3 sentence overview
- Key points extracted
- Saves reading time

**Example**:
```
Original (5 min): "So I had this meeting with the client..."
Summary: "Client meeting discussed Q4 budget. They want 3
         new features by December. Action: Schedule follow-up."
```

### 2. **Action Items Detection**
Automatically finds tasks mentioned:
- "Need to call John"
- "Schedule meeting for Friday"
- "Buy groceries"

→ Extracted as actionable tasks!

### 3. **Smart Categorization**
AI assigns relevant tags:
- Voice note about work → `#work`, `#meetings`, `#projects`
- Personal note → `#personal`, `#ideas`, `#todo`
- Auto-learns from your patterns

### 4. **Sentiment Analysis**
Detects tone:
- 😊 Positive
- 😐 Neutral
- 😞 Negative

Useful for tracking mood, stress levels, or customer feedback.

### 5. **Priority Detection**
Automatically flags urgent notes:
- 🔴 High - Contains words like "urgent", "ASAP", "critical"
- 🟡 Medium - Normal tasks, meetings
- 🟢 Low - Ideas, random thoughts

### 6. **Semantic Search**
Search by meaning, not just keywords:
- Query: "client complaints"
- Finds: Notes about "unhappy customers", "feedback issues"
- Uses AI embeddings for understanding

### 7. **Daily/Weekly Summaries**
Get aggregated summaries:
```
📊 This Week's Voice Notes

Themes: Project planning, client calls, personal goals
Key Insights:
  • New project timeline agreed
  • 3 action items pending

Action Items:
